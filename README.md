## Q1: What version of your Jetson nanoâ€™s system?
7.1 (also shown in an attatched screenshot)

## Q2: What is the effect of different power modes(MAXN, 5W)?
The tradeoff between performance and power. For us one of them wasnt working correctly so we had to get a new nano that took in USB C

## Q3: What challenges did you face during the setup and how did you overcome them?
WIFI was super slow, USB overload. 

We had to alternate between using the keyboard and mouse by plugging them in alternatingly as needed/

## Q4: Can you think of a real-world problem that could be solved using the Jetson Nano? Describe how you would design and implement a solution.
You dont need cloud, so perfect for small scale self driving cars.
