Part III - Setup Github
We’ll set up Github from Jetson, you can use this to submit all your lab artifacts (Screenshots,
Documents and Code). For all the lab submissions, you can either upload the zip file on canvas
or submit a link to your Github repository
NOTE: All Github repos used for assignments must be private and only shared with the TAs.
Repos that are public or shared intentionally or unintentionally with other students will not be
evaluated.
Let’s start with creating a new Github account. If you already have an account skip to Step 2.
